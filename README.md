# BSR
Billiard Statistcs Registry

This is my first time using GitHub. I see it mentioned a lot in coding, so I wanted to try it. 

I’m working on a small app to track billiard game outcomes with friends and family. 

I’ve been using a free web hosting site and ChatGPT and Bing Chat for help. 

I’ve been doing this for 2 months and recently found Evan Kiefl’s ‘Pool Tool’ on GitHub.

I’ve been learning a lot very quickly. In programming, there are many ways to do the same thing.

With determination and the right tools, I’m pushing boundaries and constantly growing as a programmer. 
The journey is challenging but rewarding.
